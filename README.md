## 🌟 Overview

**RepairMate** is your go-to digital companion for fixing just about anything — phones, laptops, kitchen appliances, furniture, and more. Whether you're tech-savvy or terrified of tangled wires, this app was designed to **guide you step by step**, **speak to you in your language**, and make you feel like you're not alone when something breaks.

This is more than a repair app — it's your **repair buddy**, one that speaks your language, walks you through every step, and makes complex repairs feel like a breeze.

## 🚀 Features

### 🛠️ Repair Guide Explorer  
Search and browse a curated collection of **detailed repair guides** categorized by device type.  
Built using **Supabase** as the backend and synced live with real-time updates.

### 🔍 Smart Universal Search  
Because sometimes, you just don’t know what you’re looking for.  
This search tool bridges the gap between **Google**, **YouTube**, and even **official product manuals**, helping you find **exactly** what you need — even if you just type in “my fridge sounds like a dinosaur.”

### 🗣️ Multilingual Voice Instructions  
Don’t feel like reading? Or maybe English isn’t your first language?  
Tap the **“Speak” button** and hear step instructions out loud in your **preferred language**:  
- English (default)  
- Spanish  
- French  
- Urdu (yes, finally!)  

Guides are narrated step-by-step using **Expo Speech API** with an integrated **language selector** and future **translation support**.

### 📸 Step-by-Step Instructions with Visuals  
Each guide contains clearly numbered steps, visual images, and concise instructions. Designed to feel like you're flipping through a beautifully illustrated manual — minus the part where you give up and call customer service.

### 🔄 Offline-Friendly Experience *(Planned)*  
No Wi-Fi? No problem. We're planning offline support for when you're stuck in the middle of nowhere with a broken blender.

### 📄 Upload Your Own Manual *(Coming Soon)*  
Soon, you’ll be able to upload that dusty little manual that came with your IKEA chair, and RepairMate will convert it into simple **spoken instructions**, in your own language.

## 🧠 Where the Repair Guides Come From

All repair guides were fetched and structured using **Supabase** as a secure, scalable database backend. Many of the guides were manually tested, verified, and tagged with metadata like:  
- Device name  
- Category and subcategory  
- Estimated time to repair  
- Difficulty level  
- Step images and instructions

## 👩‍💻 My Story (Faliha Awan)

Hi! I’m Faliha — solo developer, baker, aspiring engineer, and now: **first-time hackathon warrior** 👩‍🚀

I joined this hackathon without a team, without experience in advanced frameworks, and without a clue about how far I could really go. But I had this burning idea:  

> _What if there was an app that spoke to you like your dad, gently guiding you through a car repair? Or like a friend who helps you fix your headphone cable instead of telling you to buy AirPods?_  

So I did it. I built **RepairMate**, from scratch, in a few days, learning every step as I went.  
No AI coding tools. No teammates. Just me, a laptop, and a ton of Google searches. 😅

Sure, not everything is perfect — some features are still under development — but for a beginner with a big idea and a goal to help people, this is just the beginning.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

RepairMate isn’t just another app — it’s a **movement towards accessibility in tech repair**.  
It’s about **giving power back** to everyday people. And I believe in its ability to help **not just thousands — but millions.**

Thank you for reviewing my project ❤️
